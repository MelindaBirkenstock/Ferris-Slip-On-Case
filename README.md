# Ferris Slip On Case

This repo contains stl files for a slip-on ferris case, one with tenting holes and one without.  
Files for both halves are provided because they are not symmetrical.  
To tent the case, M5 hardware is required.

The original slip-on case was designed by me, and the new version with tenting was designed by makenova.
